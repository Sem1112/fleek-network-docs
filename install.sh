# "Get Fleek Network" is an attempt to make our software more accessible.
# By providing scripts to automate the installation process of our software,
# we believe that it can help improve the onboarding experience of our users.
#
# Quick install: `curl https://get.fleek.network | bash`
#
# This script automates the process illustrated in our guide "Running a Node in a Docker container"
# advanced users might find better to follow the instructions in the guide
# if that's your preference, go ahead and check our guides https://docs.fleek.network
#
# For the users happy to have the script assist in the installation process of Fleek Network
# and the required dependencies, run the script at your own risk. Part of the project will
# verify if certain dependencies are installed, or needed but it won't try to customise or
# take into consideration your custom environment. If you have a custom environment, then
# is best to follow the instructions providing in our guide, as other wise risk changing
# or overriding your custom setup.
#
# This script will:
# - Check if the system has enough disk space and memory, otherwise warn the user
# - Verify is user is in Docker as Docker in Docker not supported
# - Verify if Git is installed, if not install it
# - It'll do a quick health check to confirm Git is installed correctly 
# - Verify if Docker is installed, if not install it
# - It'll do a quick health check to confirm Docker is installed correctly
# - Request a pathname where to store the Ursa repository, otherwise providing a default,
#   e.g. `/var/www/fleek-network/ursa`
# - Pull the `ursa` project repository to the preferred target directory via HTTPS
#   instead of SSH for simplicity
# - Optionally, assist on setting up and securing domain name via SSL/TLS
# - Run the Docker stack
# - Do a health check to confirm the Fleek Network Node is running
#
# Found an issue? Report it here: https://github.com/fleek-network/get.fleek.network

# Default
defaultUrsaHttpsRespository="https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa.git"

    🧙‍♀️ The installer is the assisted process illustrated in our guide \"Running a Node in a Docker container\".

    If you are happy to have the script assist you in the installaton process of Fleek Network Node,
    run it at your own risk, as there's a certain level of trust that you have to put into \"piped installers\".
    With that considered, we will ask when dependencies are missing and if happy to proceed with
    the installation by running the commands e.g. git, docker, other dependencies from third-parties, etc.
    Our script source is open to everybody and can be verified at https://github.com/fleek-network/get.fleek.network

    🦸‍♀️ Advanced users might find better to follow the instructions in our official guides.

    Here are some important notes for you:

    - The Stack should be running now and you can show/hide the log output at anytime.
      Our logs can be quite verbose, some messages show some warnings, info, etc. You
      should check our guides to understand what they mean.
      Here are some handy commands to show/hide the logs
      - Show the logs
        docker-compose -f ./docker/full-node/docker-compose.yml logs -f
      - Use the shortcut key (Ctrl-c) for sending the interrupt (terminate) signal SIGINT to the Docker logs process

    - You can stop/start the Docker Stack at anytime
      - Stop the Docker Stack
        docker-compose -f ./docker/full-node/docker-compose.yml up
      - Start the Docker Stack
        docker-compose -f ./docker/full-node/docker-compose.yml up
