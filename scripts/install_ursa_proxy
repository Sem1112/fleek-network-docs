# "Get Fleek Network" is an attempt to make our software more accessible.
# By providing scripts to automate the installation process of our software,
# we believe that it can help improve the onboarding experience of our users.
#
# Quick install: `curl https://get.fleek.network/install_ursa_proxy | bash`
#
# This script automates the setup process for ursa-proxy
# advanced users might find it better to compile and install it from source
# If that's your preference, go ahead and check our repo https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa
#
# For the users happy to have the script assist in the installation process of Fleek Network
# and the required dependencies, run the script at your own risk.
